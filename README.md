# Frontend Mentor - Recipe page solution

This is a solution to the [Recipe page challenge on Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/recipe-page-KiTsR8QQKm).

## Overview

This is a simple recipe webpage built with HTML and CSS.

It presents a complete recipe with preparation steps, an ingredients list, cooking instructions and a nutrition table.

This project is part of my web development learning journey, focusing on semantic HTML, responsive design, well-structured CSS and a clean layout

## The Challenge

The main challenge of this project was to build a clean and responsive recipe webpage using only HTML and CSS.  
I wanted to practice writing semantic HTML, organizing CSS in a structured way, and making sure the layout worked well on mobile, tablet, and desktop devices.  

Another challenge was adding a nutrition table and styling it consistently with the rest of the page while keeping the design simple and user-friendly.

## My process

1. **Planning the structure**
    Defined the main structure and elements

2. **Building with HTML**  
   - Wrote semantic HTML for each section.  
   - Used images headings, lists, tables, and paragraphs appropriately.

3. **Styling with CSS**  
   - Applied basic styling for typography, spacing, and colors.  
   - Organized the CSS into sections for readability.

4. **Making it responsive**  
   - Started with a mobile-first approach.  
   - Added media queries for mobile and desktop breakpoints.

5. **Polishing**  
   - Improved layout consistency.  
   - Added a clean and minimal design.  
   - Tested on different screen sizes.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I Learned

- I learned to write semantic HTML code and how to leverage semantic tags to improve accessibility.  
- I learned about the CSS at-rule `@layer` to create well-structured and maintainable stylesheets.  
- I learned to use the `calc()` function instead of fixed pixel values to keep the website responsive.  
- I learned to use the at-rule `@font-face` to add custom font families.  
- I learned to use CSS custom properties for better maintainability and flexibility.

## Continued Development

In future projects, I want to keep improving my skills in responsive design and accessibility.  
I also plan to explore more advanced CSS features such as grid layouts, animations, and transitions.  
Another area I want to focus on is JavaScript, so I can add interactivity to my webpages beyond static content.
